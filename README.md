This is the final project of Administration of Information Systems,a subject in the field of Computer Science and Engineering. (I am a student at the Faculty of CSE (known as FINKI) at the University of Saint Cyril and Methodius SKOPJE). 

I will create docker containers (one that holds the Spring application, another one that has the Angular application, one with Jenkins, one with nginx at the server), docker compose file for the containers and a ansible script which will be used for deployment.
